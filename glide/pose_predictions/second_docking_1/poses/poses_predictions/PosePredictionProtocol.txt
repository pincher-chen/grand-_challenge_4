It should be noted the docking box size, for one cocrytal ligand exited in 5YGX, but the size of this ligand is smaller than the docking ligands. Besides, the docking ligands are more complecated with many branched chains and aromatic rings. It will be better to use Sitemap tool to check the docking sites in the protein of 5YGX. 
1).docking site with (18.94, 40.55, -6.39) extended by box with 30A, scoring function with low precision (SP-standard precision) 
2).docking site with (25.86, 46.35, -10.64) extended by box with 20A, scoring function with high precision (XP-extra precison)
